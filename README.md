# Data-1202-Assignment-4
**Introduction** 



In this assignment, we will write a function to calculate the distribution of channel type from the top 1000 records and then Load only the top 1000 records of the
of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file, and to a database table

**Approach**


Step1: Filter 1000 rows of the “youtube_dataset.csv” which contains 4000 rows.

Step2: Create the function to calculate the distribution of channel type

Step3: Call the function to view the results

**Requirements**

Anaconda

 -For execution of python code(Jupyter Notebook)

**Execution Steps**

  1) Import Libraries

  2) Load CSV

  3) To capture the top 1000 channel types based on subscribers, datasource is sorted in descending order and assigned to a new df called "sorted df."

  4)Iloc is used to filter the first 1000 rows, which are then allocated 

  5)The new dataframe's tail indicates that the top 1000 

  6)A function is developed to determine how the top 1000 records are distributed per channel type.

  7)Function is used to display the function's 

  8)The top 1000 records are used to generate a function that plots the distribution of records by channel type.

  9)Function is used to display the function's
